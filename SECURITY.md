# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, report it privately:

- Email: **security@capibarismo.com** (preferred)
- If email is not available, open a GitHub issue with the minimum details needed and explicitly request a private escalation.

Include as much of the following as possible:

- A clear description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept is helpful)
- Affected URLs/endpoints/components
- Any logs, screenshots, or error output that help investigation

## Response and Disclosure

- We aim to acknowledge reports within **72 hours**.
- We’ll work with you on a coordinated disclosure timeline.
- We may request additional details to validate impact and scope.

## Supported Versions

- The `main` branch and the latest release are supported.
- Security fixes may be backported when feasible.

## Safe Harbor

We support good-faith security research that:

- Avoids privacy violations and data destruction
- Avoids service disruption (no DoS)
- Does not exfiltrate real user data

Thank you for helping keep the project and its users safe.
