# Environment Variables Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your actual values

# PostHog Analytics (Optional - for user analytics and session recording)
# Get your key from: https://posthog.com/
# If not provided, analytics will be disabled in development
VITE_POSTHOG_KEY=your_posthog_api_key_here

# Development Mode Settings
# Set to 'true' to call the real API in development.
# Set to 'false' (or leave unset) to use local mock data.
VITE_USE_API=false

BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_token_here

# Notes:
# - Never commit actual API keys or tokens to the repository
# - Use .env.local for local development (already in .gitignore)
# - Production values should be set in Vercel/hosting platform environment settings
# - VITE_ prefix makes the variable available to client-side code (be careful!)
