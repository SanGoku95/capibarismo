## ⚖️ RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION

### Revenue Model Risks

#### High Impact Risks:
1. **Competing with Free Official Platforms (JNE Voto Informado)**
   - **Impact:** Severe limitation on willingness to pay for similar features
   - **Mitigation:** Focus on superior UX, mobile-first design, educational content
   - **Contingency:** Pivot to pure educational/content model with sponsorships
   - **Probability:** 60%

2. **Low Premium Conversion (1% vs. 1.5% target)**
   - **Mitigation:** Extended free trials, educational value over political guidance
   - **Contingency:** Advertising-supported model with educational content
   - **Probability:** 40%

3. **Regulatory Compliance Challenges (Peru Law 29733 + JNE Rules)**
   - **Impact:** Political opinions = sensitive personal data, strict consent requirements
   - **Mitigation:** Privacy-first design, legal compliance from day 1, no political recommendations
   - **Contingency:** Pure educational content, no personalized political features
   - **Probability:** 30%

4. **Severe Seasonal Revenue Volatility (±70% swings)**
   - **Mitigation:** University partnerships, municipal elections, educational content focus
   - **Contingency:** B2B institutional focus during off-cycles
   - **Probability:** 80%

#### Medium Impact Risks:
5. **Payment Processing & Economics (15% store fees + 18% IGV tax)**
   - **Impact:** Net revenue significantly lower than gross pricing
   - **Mitigation:** Pricing strategy accounts for fees, focus on higher-value services
   - **Contingency:** Alternative payment methods (Yape/Plin) where possible
   - **Probability:** 100% (certain cost factor)

6. **University Procurement Delays (6-12 month sales cycles)**
   - **Mitigation:** Multiple partnership tracks, direct relationships with key decision makers
   - **Contingency:** Focus on B2C growth, delay institutional revenue expectations
   - **Probability:** 70%
